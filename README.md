#Set up project on local
You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

- Clone twendee repo
- In terminal run npm install
- Run npm start
- Then you can view twendee in the browser by local link
